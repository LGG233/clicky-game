This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Jeu de Mémoire : Les Stars du Cinéma Français

Built with React, *Les Stars du Cinéma Français* is a memory game where players earn a point each time they click on a different French movie star. If they click on the same person a second time, their score is reset to 0 and the game starts anew. The added challenge is that the cards reshuffle each time one is clicked, so it's easy to forget which star you have already chosen...

Good luck!

### Technologies

The app was built using Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Express, JSON, Bootstrap, React, and various NPM packages. The final app was deployed to Heroku at [https://blooming-island-60485.herokuapp.com/](https://blooming-island-60485.herokuapp.com/).

### Observations

This was a challenging assignment to get all of the React components and functions to work properly. Once there were in place, however, the game works well.
